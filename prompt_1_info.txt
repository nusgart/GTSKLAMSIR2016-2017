You don’t know which workers lied, so you have no one to blame. What do you send in on your report?

PROMPT_1=The Second Five Year plan has been in effect for a year, and it is time for you to revise production goals for the next year. You are aware that there is a conflict among your superiors about quality over quantity. Originally the plan called for a 16.5% increase in production over the five years; this was a compromise between the moderate choice of 13.5% and the radical choice of 18.9%. Molotov, a leader among the radicals, if the head of the government and you want to avoid disagreeing with him., but Stalin currently seems to be siding with the moderates. Your job is to recommend whether the production goals should be raised, lowered, or kept the same. What do you choose to do?
NUM_OPTIONS=3
OPTION_1=You recommend raising the production goals in accordance with Molotov and the other radicals. You believe that the most important thing is to produce as much material as possible to get the Soviet Union out of the current economic crisis caused by the First Five Year plan.
